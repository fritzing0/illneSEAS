    <p>Heart disease is an umbrella term, and many of those issues relate to a process called atherosclerosis.
“Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can stop the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.”
Symptoms can include shortness of breath, nausea and fatigue, pain in the shoulders, arms, chest or back, and lightheadedness.
In 2015, approximately 17.7 million people died from cardiovascular disease worldwide.
