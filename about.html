        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>At Illnesseas, we believe that being educated about current-day issues is an important part of life. Gaining a basic understanding about many different mental or physical health problems can be a confusing and incredibly difficult process, but Illnesseas is here to help. Through an interactive diagram of the human body, users can easily expand their knowledge of many important ailments that affect thousands of people every day.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Illnesseas was founded in the summer of 2018 by a team of four high school students: Riddhi, Emory, Tanvi, and Chloe. We strongly believe in the importance of awareness, and are passionate about helping the world feel like we do.
